## Hiya! 

You have found your way to the personal website of me - a 22 y/o Informatics student home-based in Munich. 

As a fellow Wielder of Code, I enjoy contributing to problems that can be solved with software engineering tools and techniques. I aim to make the most out of opportunities to improve my understanding of topics and technologies that I've encountered so far. I am steadily honing my algorithmic and computational thinking abilities in order to become a more effective and compatible contributor to the industry.

During my free-time, you can find me exploring outdoors, stuck to a wall with colorful stones wearing the world's most uncomfortable shoes, consuming / re-creating foods or holding (and reading) a good book (latest: Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah).
