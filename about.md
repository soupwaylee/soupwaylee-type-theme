Hi! 

You have landed on the personal website of me - a 22 y/o Informatics student home-based in Munich. 

As a fellow Wielder of Code, I enjoy contributing to problems that can be solved with software engineering techniques or tools while making the most out of opportunities to improve my understanding of topics and technologies that I've encountered so far. I am steadily honing my algorithmic and computational thinking abilities in order to become a more effective and compatible contributor to the global industry.

During my free-time, you can find me exploring outdoors in nature, exploring / consuming / re-creating foods or holding (and reading) a good book (latest: Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood by Trevor Noah).
